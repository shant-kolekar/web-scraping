# Web Scraping Project: Sentiment Analysis of TCS Interview Reviews

## Project Overview

This project involves scraping all interview reviews associated with TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) from Glassdoor. The goal was to build a classification model based on the sentiment of the reviews, experience and level of interviews, and the week of the year. We used the Word2Vec pretrained model to convert the reviews into word embeddings and analyzed them using various machine learning techniques.

## Project Goals

Our primary objectives in this project were to:

- Scrape interview reviews associated with TCS from Glassdoor.
- Perform sentiment analysis on the reviews and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Convert the reviews into word embeddings using the Word2Vec pretrained model.
- Build a classification model using sentiment, experience, level of interview, and the week of the year as features.
- Evaluate the performance of the model and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Data Source

We used Glassdoor as the source of our data, where we scraped interview reviews associated with TCS.

## Technologies Used

We utilized the following technologies to carry out this project:

- __Python__ for programming and automation
- __Selenium__ for web scraping
- __Scikit-learn__ for machine learning models and evaluation
- __Pandas__ for data manipulation and analysis
- __Matplotlib and Seaborn__ for data visualization
- __TensorFlow__ for deep learning models
- __Word2Vec pretrained model (genism)__ for converting reviews into word embeddings.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the effectiveness of web scraping, sentiment analysis, and word embeddings for extracting valuable insights from online sources. By incorporating features such as word embeddings and the week of the year, we built a classification model that accurately predicted the sentiment of interview reviews. Further improvements to the model could involve adding more features or using more advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the performance and accuracy of the model.
