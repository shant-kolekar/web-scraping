## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are:

- To extract interview reviews associated with TCS from Glassdoor.
- To perform sentiment analysis on the reviews to determine whether they are positive, negative, or neutral.
- To create a classification model based on the sentiment of the reviews, the experience of interviews, and the level of interviews.
- To evaluate the performance of the classification model and make recommendations for improving it.

## Data Source

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the potential of web scraping and sentiment analysis for extracting valuable insights from online sources. By creating a classification model based on interview reviews, we can gain a deeper understanding of the sentiment and experiences associated with TCS interviews. Further improvements to the model could involve incorporating additional features, such as interview questions and job titles, or using more advanced machine learning techniques.
